Stock Portfolio Tracker is a simple web-based application built using Python and Flask that allows users to manually track their stock investments. Users can input stock symbols and quantities, and the app calculates the total investment value using a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices. The portfolio summary is displayed dynamically in a web interface, and users have the option to export their portfolio data as a CSV file. This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as dictionaries, form handling, conditional logic, arithmetic operations, file I/O, and web development using Flask. Ideal for beginners learning backend web development or basic financial app prototypes.# CodeAlpha_Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
